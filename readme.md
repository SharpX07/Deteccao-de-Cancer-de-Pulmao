Deep learning model for histological lung cancer classification using InceptionV3 with Transfer Learning.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project implements a convolutional neural network based on InceptionV3 architecture to classify lung cancer histopathology images into four categories:
- Adenocarcinoma
- Squamous Cell Carcinoma
- Large Cell Carcinoma
- Normal Tissue
